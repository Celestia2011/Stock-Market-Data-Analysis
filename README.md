📝 Project Overview

This project performs in-depth analysis of stock market data from various well-known companies such as Netflix, Amazon, Apple, Samsung, and others. The dataset includes critical stock information such as Open, High, Low, Close prices, Volume, Dividends, Stock Splits, and metadata related to each company.
🔑 Key Features:

    Dataset Columns:
        Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, Dividends, Stock Splits, Brand_Name, Ticker, Industry_Tag, Country
    Companies Analyzed:
        Netflix, Amazon, Apple, Samsung, Peloton, etc.

📊 Visualizations

Several visualizations were created to provide insights into the stock data:

    Time Series Plot: Trends of stock prices over time.
    Candlestick Chart: Visually represents the stock's Open, High, Low, and Close prices.
    Box Plot: Illustrates the distribution of stock prices.
    Bar Plot: Depicts categorical data such as stock splits and dividends.
    Correlation Heatmap: Displays correlations between numerical columns (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume).
    Scatterplot: Identifies relationships between stock features.
    Histogram: Displays the distribution of stock prices.
    Confusion Matrix: Used to assess the classification model’s performance.

🎯 Classification Model: Random Forest

A Random Forest classifier was applied to classify the stock data into different categories. Below is the classification report generated by the model:
